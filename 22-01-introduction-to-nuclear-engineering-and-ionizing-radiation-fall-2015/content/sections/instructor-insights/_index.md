Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _22.01 Introduction to Nuclear Engineering and Ionizing Radiation_ as it was taught by Professor Michael Short in Fall 2015.

This course is a hands-on approach to ionizing radiation. Radiation is the central aspect that makes nuclear science and engineering (NSE) its own discipline, and sets the foundation for almost all of modern physics. The course begins by retracing the steps of famous radiation experiments and hypotheses. Next, the stage is set for the study of radiation, by showing details of the systems and reactors that use radiation. The remaining portion of the course is dedicated to describing the origins, interactions, uses, detection, and biological/chemical effects of ionizing radiation.

Course Outcomes
---------------

### Course Goals for Students

*   Develop fluency in basic nuclear physics
*   Learn about seminal radiation experiments and hypotheses
*   Explore systems and reactors that use radiation
*   Describe the origins, interactions, uses, detection, and biological/chemical effects of ionizing radiation
*   Apply knowledge of nuclear physics to evaluate quality of scientific claims
